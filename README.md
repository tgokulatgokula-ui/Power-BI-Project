**Global Climate Events Analysis Dashboard**

This repository contains the Power BI project for an interactive dashboard that analyzes the impact of global climate events. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics such as fatalities, injuries, affected populations, and economic impact across different countries and event types.

🎯 Project Overview The goal of this project is to visualize data related to various climate events and their consequences. By consolidating the information into an easy-to-understand dashboard, users can identify trends, compare the severity of different events, and analyze the impact on specific regions over time.

✨ Features The dashboard is composed of several key visualizations:

Key Metrics Cards: At-a-glance view of the total deaths, injuries, and the currently filtered event type and country.
Impact per Capita: A gauge visual showing the relative impact on a per-capita basis for the selected region.
Temporal Analysis:
Injuries by Year: A bar chart comparing the percentage of total injuries across different years.
Events Over Time: A line chart tracking the frequency or impact of events on a monthly and yearly basis.
Affected Population Trend: A waterfall chart illustrating the cumulative or yearly increase in the affected population.
Categorical Analysis:
Deaths by Year: A donut chart showing the distribution of fatalities across the years in the dataset.
Economic Impact by Event Type: A bar chart comparing the economic consequences of different climate events (Cold Wave, Drought, Earthquake, Flood, etc.).
Affected Population by Country: A pie chart displaying the proportion of the total affected population by country. Interactive Controls Users can dynamically filter the entire report by:
Event Type (e.g., Cold Wave, Flood, Drought)
Country
